This configuration file contains the parameters required to process images and segment components. Below is the description of each field:
    - k: (float) The tolerance level for similarity between pixel colors. Higher values allow more variation within a segment.
    - use8Way: (boolean) Determines the connectivity type for flood fill. Set true for 8-way connectivity, false for 4-way connectivity.
    - euclidif: (boolean) Specifies whether the Euclidean distance between colors is used as a similarity metric.
    - adj: (boolean) Indicates if adjacency criteria should be applied for component grouping.
    - minComponentSize: (integer) The minimum size (in pixels) required for a component to be saved, to keep only building blocks, heuristic.
    - buildingBlockTreshold (float): The treshold for the average probability of being part of a building block, of each pixel in the component image, so it is considered a building block
